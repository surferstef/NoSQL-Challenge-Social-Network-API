# NoSQL-Challenge-Social-Network-API


## Purpose
This application showcases use of MongoDB for a social media API backend. Here, we are building an API for a social network Web App, which allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. This leverages the Express.js framework for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
